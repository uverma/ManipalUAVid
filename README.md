Finely Annonated UAV Aerial Video Dataset for Semantic Segmentation


In the last few years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have been used for various applications such as object detection and tracking, action recognition, etc. There exist different datasets for evaluating the performance of these tasks. However, there is no standard dataset with fine annotation for semantic segmentation of UAV aerial videos. In this work, a new UAV aerial video dataset is developed for semantic segmentation. This dataset contains aerial videos of a closed campus (Manipal Institute of Technology, India) captured using DJI Phantom 3 Professional drone with 1280 x 720 resolution. We provide a four-class fine annotation (Greenery, Construction, Road, and Water Bodies) describing the general layout of the scene.
